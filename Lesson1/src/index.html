      <h4>TO LEON WERTH</h4>
      <p>
        I ask the indulgence of the children who may read this book for
        dedicating it to a grown-up. I have a serious reason: he is the best
        friend I have in the world. I have another reason: this grown-up
        understands everything, even books about children. I have a third
        reason: he lives in France where he is hungry and cold. He needs
        cheering up. If all these reasons are not enough, I will dedicate the
        book to the child from whom this grown-up grew. All grown-ups were once
        children - although few of them remember it. And so I correct my
        dedication:
      </p>

        Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book,
        called <i>True Stories from Nature</i> , about the primeval forest. It
        was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal.
        Here is a copy of the drawing.
